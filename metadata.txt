On Thu June 9, 2016 I noticed that I had a few video files for Wait Until Dark (1967) with 
Aubrey Hepburn to be processed under ~/Downloads/latest/ to be processed that had come off
of one of the two TiVos.  I created ~/Downloads/latest/Wait Until Dark (1967) [420p]
and moved the files there:

$ ls -1 ~/Downloads/latest/Wait\ Until\ Dark\ \(1967\)\ \[420p\]/
Wait-Until-Dark-1967.txt
Wait Until Dark.jpg
Wait Until Dark.m4v
Wait Until Dark.mpeg
Wait Until Dark.png
Wait Until Dark.TiVo
$

Can convert the TiVo file to mpeg using:
  malachite:~/Downloads/latest/Wait Until Dark (1967) [420p]/tmp2$ \
  tivodecode --dump-metadata "Wait Until Dark.TiVo" > "Wait Until Dark.mpeg"
  Encryption by QUALCOMM ;)

  End of File
  marcilr@malachite:~/Downloads/latest/Wait Until Dark (1967) [420p]/tmp2$

The --dump-metadata options generated two metadata XML files with movie details
along with the mpeg:
  marcilr@malachite:~/Downloads/latest/Wait Until Dark (1967) [420p]/tmp2$ ls -1
  chunk-01-0001.xml
  chunk-02-0002.xml
  Wait Until Dark.mpeg
  Wait Until Dark.TiVo
  marcilr@malachite:~/Downloads/latest/Wait Until Dark (1967) [420p]/tmp2$

The xml files have cast, director, writer, other juicy details.  Now need the
syntax to extract the values I need.
